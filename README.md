# HOME-AUTOMATION

## Project Statement
  This project revolves around creating a home automation system prototype with the main focus being the ability to control lighting the bulbs using claps and regulating    the climate in the house automatically using a temperature sensor that triggers the fan. 
  This project aims to develop a prototype of a product capable of regulating climate in the house automatically as well as lighting the house automatically by clapping.
